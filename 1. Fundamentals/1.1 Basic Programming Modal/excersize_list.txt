Recurssion:
    Thumbrule for writting Recursive programm
        1.  The recursion has a base caseâ€”we always include a conditional statement as the
            first statement in the program that has a return.
        2.  Recursive calls must address subproblems that are smaller in some sense, so
            that recursive calls converge to the base case. In the code below, the difference
            between the values of the fourth and the third arguments always decreases.
        3.  (Imp)Recursive calls should not address subproblems that overlap. In the code below,
            the portions of the array referenced by the two subproblems are disjoint.

        Violating any of these guidelines is likely to lead to incorrect results or a spectacularly
        inefficient program 
        (see Exercises 1.1.19 and 1.1.27).
